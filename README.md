👋 Hi, I’m Maham (@Maham9521)
👀 About Me
I’m a dedicated software engineer with a strong passion for web development, cross-platform development, security auditing for existing systems, and quantum computing. I thrive on exploring cutting-edge technologies, tackling complex challenges, and continuously advancing my skill set to deliver innovative solutions.

🌱 Currently Learning
Right now, I’m diving deeper into Angular (the latest versions are a game-changer), React, Electron.js, scalable libraries, Python 3, Qiskit, and cloud computing. My focus is on creating robust offline applications that provide seamless experiences akin to those connected to the internet. I'm particularly interested in offline-first applications and building scalable web platforms.

💞️ Collaboration
I’m eager to collaborate on open-source projects, innovative tech solutions, and any initiatives where I can make a meaningful impact. If you have a project or idea in mind, I’d love to hear from you!
